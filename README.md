# Envision AR Experience

This demo is for my 3rd-place international DECA project. It uses augmented reality to help customers visualize different products, allowing customers to better understand the products before purchasing them.

## Usage

This app works using [Zappar](https://www.zappar.com), an AR company that allows users to put an augmented reality experience in a QR code. My partner and I used this QR code to make it easier for the judge to use. It has 3 different demos.

**Virtual Product Modeling:**

The first service allowed customers to visualize products without actually purchasing them. In this demo, we used different lamps to show the judge how they would look on a desk.

**Interactive Experiences:**

Our second service was any interactive experience, such as a game, that would engage a customer with a brand. In this example, we did a March Madness promotion by creating a basketball game.

**Fashion Visualization Experience:**

This service allows customers to visualize fashion items before purchasing them. For this demo we allowed them to try on different sunglasses.
